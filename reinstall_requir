Recreating the Virtual Environment:

    When another developer clones your repository, they can recreate the virtual environment and install the exact dependencies by running:

*python -m venv env      # Create a new virtual environment (if it doesn't exist)
*source env/bin/activate # Activate the virtual environment (on macOS and Linux)
*pip install -r requirements.txt   # Install dependencies from requirements.txt
